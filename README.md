This networking library is free to use as long as you comply to the GNU GPL v2 license (see LICENSE.txt for details). For clarification, you may compile this library into a jar archive and include it as a dependency in any project of your own, commercial or non-commercial, as long as credit is given to me. Furthermore, I reserve the exclusive right to re-license this library, either for use in specific projects or for public use.
